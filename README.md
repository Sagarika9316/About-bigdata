### Big Data With Examples and Types
1. Structured

2. Unstructured

3. Semi-structured

**_Structured_**

Data that has a set format for efficient access by both software and people is referred to as structured data. Typically, it is tabular with clearly defined rows and columns for data properties.

##### Examples

Tables, Relational Databases, XML, JSON

| Sno | Name | Age |
| --- | ---  | --- |
| 1   | John | 30  |
| 2   | Jane | 25  |
| 3   | Bob  | 35  |


**_Unstructured_**

Unstructured data, which includes emails, text messages, photos, videos, and audio files, is all the information that isn't predetermined and searchable in a table. Unstructured data cannot be immediately evaluated and searched without additional processing, in contrast to structured data, which can be easily inserted into tables like those available in Microsoft Excel.

##### Examples

Books, Journals, Documents, metadata, audio, videos

**_Semi-structured_**

The phrase "semi-structured data" (also known as "partially structured data") describes a class of data that does not follow the tabular structure present in relational databases or other types of data tables, but does have tags and metadata that separate semantic elements and create hierarchies of records and fields.
